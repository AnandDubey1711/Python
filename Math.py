# In this section we will be looking into the math function in python and to do so we need to import the math library
import math

# Declaring some variables to show the methods
pi = 3.14
x, y, z = 1,2,3

# To round off a float value round method is used
print(round(pi))

# To get the ceiling value ceil method is used
print(math.ceil(pi))

# To get the floor value of lower bound floor is used
print(math.floor(pi))

# To get the positive (absolute) value of an variable abs method is used it tells jow much away the value is from zero 
print(abs(pi))

# To raise the number to a power
print(pow(pi,2))

# To get the sqrt of a number
print(math.sqrt(z))

# max function is used to find the max value among multiple values
print(max(x,y,z))

# min function is used to find the min value among multiple values
print(min(x,y,z))
